	<h2>Terms</h2>
	<footer class="spacing-bottom-med">(Last Updated: April 20, 2020)</footer>
	<p>This is an explanation of the things you should know about using <em>vested</em>, a service provided by <em>vested</em>. We have tried to make it as clear and straightforward as possible, because that is how we would want to be treated. If you find anything in here confusing, please let us know by contacting us at team@vestedapp.com.</p>

  <h4>Acceptance of Terms</h4>
	<p>These are the Terms governing your use of the services provided to you through the <em>vested</em> application, websites and software, including content, updates, and new releases (collectively, the "Services"). By signing up for <em>vested</em>, using the <em>vested</em> application  or visiting the <em>vested</em> website (www.vestedapp.com), you understand and agree to the Terms outlined here. You also agree to our privacy policy (www.vestedapp.com/privacy). The term ‚ÄúServices‚Äù includes the websites, services, features, content or applications offered by¬†<em>vested</em>, as part of¬†<em>WellnessLabs</em>, and ‚ÄúContent‚Äù includes any information, data, text, images, content, materials, software, and features generated, provided or otherwise made accessible on or through the Services.</p>

	<p>We ask that you please read these Terms carefully, including the sections labeled ‚ÄúArbitration‚Äù, ‚ÄúArbitration Restrictions‚Äù and ‚ÄúExceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration‚Äù. These sections limit <em>vested</em>‚Äôs liability to you and require individual arbitration for legal disputes between you and <em>vested</em>. If you have questions about these sections, or any part of these Terms, get in touch! We‚Äôll be happy to help. team@vestedapp.com.</p>

  <p>If you do not accept the Terms of use contained here (the ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù or the ‚ÄúTerms‚Äù), you understand and acknowledge that you will not be allowed to use the¬†vested app or website.</p>

  <h4>Not a Financial Planner, Broker, Accountant, Tax Advisor, or Attorney</h4>
  <p><em>vested</em> does not provide financial planning services, brokerage services, tax, accounting, or legal advice. You should contact your own financial planner or broker, tax advisor, accountant and/or attorney before making any decisions that have tax or legal implications. While <em>vested</em> can tailor your financial goals to help you save more money, you are the sole entity responsible for all financial decisions. As such, <em>vested</em>is not liable if you are unable to complete a financial goal or save a specific sum of money.</p>

  <p>Services are intended only to assist you in your financial organization and decision-making and are broad in scope. Your personal financial situation is unique, and any information and advice obtained through the Services may not be appropriate for your situation. Accordingly, before making any final decisions or implementing any financial strategy, you should consider whether it may be appropriate to obtain additional tailored advice from your accountant or other financial advisors who are fully aware of your individual financial circumstances.</p>

  <h4>Information from Third-Party Sites</h4>
	<p>To provide <em>vested</em>, <em>vested</em> connects to your bank or credit union account to retrieve your account transaction history. We use your transaction history to determine your income and expenses. Accordingly, when you sign up for <em>vested</em>, we ask you to sign into your bank or credit union account.</p>
	<p>You may also direct <em>vested</em> to retrieve information maintained by third-parties with which you have relationships, maintain accounts or engage in financial transactions (‚ÄúAccount Information‚Äù). <em>vested</em> works with one or more third-party service providers, to access this Account Information. By enrolling in <em>vested</em>, you authorize <em>vested</em> to access this information maintained by identified third parties, on your behalf as your agent, and you expressly authorize such third parties to disclose your information to us.</p>
  <p>By agreeing to these Terms, you are also agreeing that you are responsible for keeping your passwords and usernames for this Account Information secure and for keeping those passwords and usernames up to date in the <em>vested</em> app. <em>vested</em> does not review the Account Information for accuracy, legality or non-infringement, and <em>vested</em> is not responsible for your Account Information or products and services offered by or on third-party sites. You can read more about who we work with in our privacy policy (www.vestedapp.com/privacy).</p>

  <h4>Your Rights To Use The Services And Restrictions</h4>

  <p>The Services may periodically be updated with tools, utilities, improvements, third-party applications, or general updates to improve and enhance the features and performance of the Services. You agree to receive these updates automatically as part of the Services.</p>
  <p>You are responsible for your own actions while using the Services. In particular, you should not use the Services while driving or at any other time when use of the Services may disrupt your attention to other matters and result in injury to yourself or others.</p>

We may terminate your use of the application for any reason at any time upon notice to you. Termination may happen, for example, if we discover that you are using <em>vested</em> in a way that violates these Terms.

	<p>You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates and each of our and their respective employees, contractors, directors, suppliers and representatives from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys‚Äô fees, that arise from or relate to your misuse of, or access to, the Services or Content, violation of these Terms, or infringement by you (or any third-party using your <em>vested</em> account or identity in the Services) of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity.

  <h4>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h4>
	<p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United States of America without regard to its conflicts of law rules. You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state courts in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>

  <h4>Arbitration</h4>
	<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</p>
	<p>Except as explicitly provided in these Terms, any dispute or claim (whether or not such dispute or claim involves a third-party), relating in any way to your use of the Services, Content, or product offered or provided by or through the Services, or otherwise arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Services or the Content that cannot be resolved directly between you and <em>vested</em> shall be resolved by non-appearance based binding arbitration, rather than in court. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, this includes any claims based in contract, statute, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms. There is no judge or jury in arbitration and court review of an arbitration award is limited, but an arbitrator can award an individual the same damages and relief as a court and must apply and follow these Terms as a court would.</p>
	<p>Either you or we can initiate arbitration through the alternative dispute resolution provider the American Arbitration Association (the ‚ÄúAAA‚Äù) pursuant to the then-current Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (the ‚ÄúConsumer Rules‚Äù), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration will take place in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts unless the parties otherwise agree in writing. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator. If you and we cannot agree on who that single arbitrator should be, then the AAA shall appoint an arbitrator. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, <em>vested</em> will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.</p>
	<p>The arbitration shall be conducted by telephone or electronic means and/or shall be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner of which shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the arbitrator determines that an in-person hearing is necessary based on the request of one of the parties and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and <em>vested</em> each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial and agree to proceed only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. The parties hereby appoint the arbitrator the exclusive power to rule on any challenges to the requirement for the use of alternative dispute resolution process in these Terms.</p>
	<p>Additionally, you or we may bring suit in court to obtain interim or preliminary injunctive relief necessary to protect the rights or property of you or <em>vested</em> and all of its partners, affiliates, shareholders, employees, and agents of any kind (together, our ‚ÄúAffiliates‚Äù).</p>
  <p>Except as explicitly provided in elsewhere in these Terms, all claims you bring against <em>vested</em> must be resolved in accordance with this Section. Any claim filed or brought contrary to this Section may be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section, <em>vested</em> may recover from you attorneys' fees and costs up to $1,500 per claim, provided that <em>vested</em> first has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p>

  <h4>Arbitration Restrictions</h4>
	<p>You and <em>vested</em> agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the dispute between <em>vested</em> and you individually. To the fullest extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
	<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this section will be null and void. These arbitration provisions will survive the termination of your relationship with us.</p>

  <h4>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h4>
	<p>You and <em>vested</em> agree that the following disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or <em>vested</em>‚Äôs intellectual property rights; and (2) any claim for injunctive relief.</p>

  <h4>Miscellaneous Items</h4>
	<p>These Terms represent the entire agreement between you and <em>vested</em> with respect to <em>vested</em>. They supersede any other communications you have with us regarding the <em>vested</em>, such as by email or phone. If any part of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, only that part will be removed or limited as needed, but the rest of these Terms will stay intact. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created under these Terms, and neither you nor <em>vested</em> has any authority to bind the other in any way. The paragraph headings in these Terms are for convenience only and do not affect any provision‚Äôs meaning or interpretation.</p>
	<p>All provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>
	<p>Additionally, since <em>vested</em> is an application for iPhone, Apple, Inc. (‚ÄúApple‚Äù) requires that we post something they call their ‚ÄúDevice and Application Terms‚Äù. The important thing to know is that these Terms are an agreement between you and <em>vested</em>, not between you and Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the Services or any application related to them, whether accessed on a device provided by Apple or obtained through the Apple App Store (which application, in either case, will be referenced below as an ‚ÄúApplication‚Äù). In addition:</p>

		<li>The Application is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sub-licensable basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for your private, personal, non-commercial use, subject to all of these Terms as they are applicable to the Services;</li>

    <li>You acknowledge and agree that <em>vested</em>, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third-party may have in relation to the Application;</li>
		<li>You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third-party claim that the Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes that third-party‚Äôs intellectual property rights, <em>vested</em>, and not Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim;</li>

	<p>Also, these Terms are specific to the relationship between you and <em>vested</em>, so you may not transfer any part of the agreement between you and <em>vested</em> to anyone else, or assign any part of your relationship with <em>vested</em> to another person or organization. If, at some point, we fail to enforce any part of these Terms, that does not mean we waive our rights to enforce these Terms in the future. If we decide to make a special exception and waive your obligation to follow any part of these Terms, we will notify you in writing.</p>
	<p>Finally, sometimes we may need to change these Terms. For example, we might need to make changes if we add a new feature to <em>vested</em>. We will notify you by changing the revision date at the top of this page, and in some cases we will notify you directly, by email or by in-app notification. Your continued use of <em>vested</em> after a modification signifies your agreement to the modification. We encourage you to review frequently these Terms to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of <em>vested</em>. We will always be happy to answer any questions about these changes, and you can get in touch at team@vestedapp.com.</p>
