  <h4 class="spacing-top">General</h4>
  <p><em>vested</em> (‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúus‚Äù and/or ‚Äúour‚Äù) is dedicated to protecting your personal information and informing you about how we use it. This privacy policy (the ‚ÄúPrivacy Policy‚Äù or the ‚ÄúPolicy‚Äù) is intended to provide information to our visitors (‚Äúyou,‚Äù ‚Äúyour‚Äù) about how we collect, protect, share and use your information as part of our technology platforms, including, without limitation, our company website (the ‚ÄúSite‚Äù), mobile sites and/or applications (together with the Site, the ‚ÄúServices‚Äù). This Privacy Policy outlines how and when <em>vested</em> collects, protects, shares, and uses information that can identify you individually (‚ÄúPersonal Information‚Äù), such as your name, email, telephone number, employment information, or payment information (such as paycheck information, account information or debit card numbers). Personal Information does not include information that is anonymous, aggregated, or can no longer be used to identify you as an individual. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information through the Services. By using or submitting information through the Services, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into <em>vested</em>‚Äôs Terms of Service at&nbsp;https://vestedapp.com/terms. Any capitalized term that is not defined in this Policy shall have the meaning given to it in the Terms of Service. This Privacy Policy covers the privacy practices of <em>vested</em> only. This Policy does not apply to the practices of third-party websites, services or applications, including third parties with which we partner. These third-party services are governed by each such third-party‚Äôs privacy policy. <em>vested</em> is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of technology platforms other than that of <em>vested</em>, and <em>vested</em> is not responsible for the failure of unaffiliated third parties to honor their privacy obligations.</p>

  <h4>How We Use Information</h4>
  <p>We may use the information we collect for a variety of reasons related to our operation and your use of the Services. We may combine information about you that we collect on-line, via mobile applications, and from third-party sources.</p>
  <p>Examples of specific ways in which <em>vested</em> may use your Personal Information include, but are not limit to the following:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Responding to your requests (including, for example, if you contact us to ask a question or report an issue with the Services, we may use the Personal Information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem);</li>
    <li>Improving the content, appearance and utility of the Services;</li>
    <li>Tracking our visitors‚Äô use of the Services for internal research purposes and to enhance our product messaging to you;</li>
    <li>Providing necessary notices to you and notifying you about updates to the Services;</li>
    <li>Assessing your eligibility for an Account;</li>
    <li>Configuring your Account settings;</li>
    <li>Communicating with you about your Account and use of the Services;</li>
    <li>Providing interactive features, such as product reviews or research surveys;</li>
    <li>Monitoring against theft and fraud.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Information We Collect</h4>
  <p>When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Information and other information from you, as further described below:</p>
  <p><em>Personal Information That You Provide Through the Services:</em> We collect Personal Information from you when you provide such information, such as when you create an account (‚ÄúAccount‚Äù), complete and/or use one of our online forms, tools or content items, contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, or use certain Services. If you sign up for the Services, you will be asked to provide Personal Information such as your email address, first and last name, telephone number, banking information, and other information that identifies you. The Personal Information we collect is for the sole purpose of enhancing the experience of our Services. We do not collect citizenship, race, nationality, or other demographic data.</p>

  <h4>Information We Collect Automatically</h4>
  <p><em>Site Usage Information:</em> <em>vested</em> may use a variety of technologies that passively or automatically collect information about how the Services are accessed and used, including your browser type, device type, operating system, application version, the pages served to you, the time you browse, preceding page views, and your use of particular features of the Services. This statistical data helps us understand what is interesting and relevant to customers of the Services so that we can best tailor our content to you.</p>
  <p><em>Device Identifiers:</em> <em>vested</em> also automatically collects IP address or other unique identifier for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively ‚ÄúDevice‚Äù) you use to access the Services. A ‚ÄúDevice Identifier‚Äù is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Services, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track customers' web page movements, monitor against theft and fraud, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. If you access the Services on a mobile Device, we may request access to settings and location information for similar purposes and to personalize your experience with the Services. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services or push notifications. Please note that if you choose not to provide us with your location information, you may not be able to use all of the features of the Services.</p>
  <p><em>Session Trackers:</em> In operating the Services, we may use cookies and similar session tracking technologies (‚ÄúSession Trackers‚Äù). Session trackers help provide additional functionality to the Services, customize customers' experiences with the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately for research and product development purposes. We (including third parties that we work with) may place session trackers on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate navigation of the Services, and to personalize your experience while using our Services. If you would prefer not to accept Session Trackers when using the Services, follow the instructions provided by your website or mobile browser (usually located within the ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù, ‚ÄúTools‚Äù or ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù facility) to modify your Session Tracker settings. Please note that if you disable Session Trackers, you may not be able to access certain parts of our Services and other parts of our Services may not work properly. As a result, we recommend that you leave Session Trackers turned on when accessing the Services because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Services‚Äô features.</p>
  <p><em>Web Beacons:</em> In addition to Session Trackers, we may use web beacons (also known as ‚Äúclear GIFs‚Äù), which are transparent graphic images placed on a web page or in an email and indicate that a page or email has been viewed or tell your browser to get content from another server. We use web beacons to measure traffic to or from, or use of, our online forms, tools or content items and related browsing behavior and to improve your experience when using the Services. We may also use customized links or other similar technologies to track hyperlinks that you click and associate that information with your Personal Information in order to provide you with more focused communications.</p>
  <p><em>Non-Personal Information:</em> Additionally, we may modify and combine Personal Information in a manner that does not personally identify you or any other individual and thus, no longer constitutes ‚ÄúPersonal Information‚Äù. We may use this non-Personal Information, such as aggregate customer statistics, demographic information, and usage information, for the purpose of enhancing the experience of our Services.</p>

  <h4>Information from Third Parties</h4>
  <p>We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, the Services may include features from social media platforms such as Facebook, and we may enable you to register or log-in to the Services through a social media platform. These features use Session Trackers to collect information about your IP address, and your use of the Services. Your interactions with those features are governed by the terms of use and privacy policies of the companies that provide them.</p>
  <p>As another example, we use Plaid Technologies, Inc. (‚ÄúPlaid‚Äù) to gather your data from financial institutions. By using the Services, you grant us and Plaid the right, power, and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and financial information from the relevant financial institution. You agree to your personal and financial information being transferred, stored, and processed by Plaid in accordance with the Plaid Privacy Policy located at https://plaid.com/legal.</p>
  <p>We may also receive Personal Information about you from third parties, such as financial data vendors, your employer, or financial services companies with whom we‚Äôve partnered, to evaluate your eligibility for an Account, to enhance our ability to tailor our services to you, or for other reasons. If we combine such data with information we collect through the Services, such information is subject to this Privacy Policy unless we have disclosed otherwise.</p>

  <h4>Marketing or promotional purposes</h4>
  <p><em>Email Communications.</em> We may use your Personal Information to provide you with marketing or other promotional communications via email. If, at any time, you would like to stop receiving these promotional e-mails, you may follow the opt-out instructions contained in any such e-mail. Please note that by opting out, you may prohibit <em>vested</em> from informing you of offerings that may be of interest to you. It may take up to ten business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails or promotions from us, we still may send you e-mails about your Account or any products or services you have requested or received from us, or for other customer service purposes.</p>

  <h4>When do we disclose the Personal Information we collect?</h4>
  <p>Except as provided herein, <em>vested</em> will not sell, rent or otherwise disclose Personal Information about you to third parties.</p>
  <p><em>Third-party providers.</em> We may share your Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties that provide certain services to us, including, but not limited to data analysis, payment processing, and risk management. These third parties may have access to Personal Information or non-Personal Information in order to perform their functions on our behalf. However, these third parties are only permitted to use your Personal Information for the purpose for which it has been provided or to administer, service or process transactions that you have authorized, and may not disclose it to any other third-party except at our express direction and in accordance with this Policy. We do not share your Personal Information with: (1) other financial companies for joint marketing purposes; (2) affiliated companies for their everyday business purposes; or (3) any third parties so that they can market to you.</p>
  <p><em>Business transfers.</em> As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or our assets, or assets related to the Services, Personal Information, information about how the Services are accessed and used, and any other information that we have collected about the customers of the Services may be disclosed to such entity as one of the transferred assets. Additionally if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.</p>
  <p><em>Legal disclosures.</em> <em>vested</em> may transfer and disclose information, including your Personal Information, information about how the Services are accessed and used, and information from our service providers, to third parties to comply with a legal obligation; when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; to verify or enforce our Terms of Service or other applicable policies; to respond to an emergency; or otherwise to protect the rights, property, safety or security of third parties, visitors to our Services or the public; and with your permission. At your direction or request, we may share your Personal Information with specified third parties.</p>

However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us. You use the Services and provide us with your Personal Information at your own risk.</p>
  <p>Your Account is authenticated using SMS Device verification for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and Personal Information by implementing and protecting your Device password appropriately and limiting access to your Device. We also recommend that you change your Device password periodically. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account username and password.

  <h4>Children Under 13</h4>
  <p>The Services are not directed to children under 13 years of age and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13.
